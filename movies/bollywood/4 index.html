            Bollywood, Hindi-language sector of the Indian <br>
            moviemaking industry that began in Bombay <b>(now Mumbai)</b><br>
            in the 1930s and developed into an enormous film empire.

        After early Indian experiments in silent film, in 1934 <br>
        Bombay Talkies, launched by Himansu Rai, spearheaded the <br>
        growth of Indian cinema. Over the years, several classic <br>
        genres emerged from Bollywood: the historical epic, <br>
        notably Mughal-e-Azam <b>(1960);</b> the curry western, <br>
        such as Sholay <b>(1975);</b> the courtesan film, such as <br>
        Pakeezah <b>(1972),</b> which highlights stunning cinematography <br>
        and sensual dance choreography; and the mythological movie, <br>
        represented by Jai Santoshi Maa <b>(1975).</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Stars, rather than plots, were often the driving force <br>
        behind the films. Beginning in 1936, when Ashok Kumar and <br>
        Devika Rani emerged as the first major star pair, <br>
        the Indian public developed an insatiable appetite for news <br>
        about their screen heroes. This interest continued with <br>
        male actors such as <i><b>Raj Kapoor, Dilip Kumar,</b></i><br>
        and <b><i>Dev Anand</i></b> in the 1950s and ’60s, <br>
        <i><b>Rajesh Khanna</b></i> in the ’70s, 
        <i><b>Amitabh Bachchan</b></i> in the ’80s, <br>
        and <i><b>Shah Rukh Khan</b></i> <br>
        in the ’90s.Popular female icons included <br>
        <i><b>Madhubala</b></i> in the 1950s, <br>
        <i><b>Mumtaz</b></i> in the ’60s, <i><b>Zeenat Aman</b></i> in the ’70s, <br>
        <i><b>Hema Malini</b></i> in the ’80s, and <i><b>Madhuri Dixit</b></i> <br>
        and <i><b>Kajol</b></i> in the ’90s.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the turn of the 21st century, the Indian film <br>
        industry—of which Bollywood remained the largest <br>
        component—was producing as many as 1,000 feature <br>
        films annually in all of <b><i>India’s</i></b> major languages <br>
        and in a variety of cities, and international audiences <br>
        began to develop among South Asians in the United Kingdom <br>
        and in the <b><i>United States.</i></b> Standard features of Bollywood <br>
        films continued to be formulaic story lines, expertly <br>
        choreographed fight scenes, spectacular song-and-dance <br>
        routines, emotion-charged <b><i>melodrama,</i></b> and larger-than-life <br>
        heroes. Indian actor, model, and singer <b><i>Priyanka Chopra</i></b><br>
        <b><i>Jonas,</i></b> married to pop star Nick Jonas of the<br> 
        <b><i>Jonas Brothers,</i></b> rose to international stardom after she was <br>
        crowned Miss World in 2000 and became one of India’s <br>
        highest-paid actresses, in and out of Bollywood.
